# This file is a YAML representation of Arma 3's stringtable.xml containers and keys
# This file is read in and transformed into the full stringtable.xml file that we know and love
#
# Note: The build process will transform this data into something XML can understand. All "id"
# values defined will automatically have `STR_ESM_` prepended to them
#
# Syntax:
#
# Each root key represents a <Container> entry in the resulting XML. The associated value
# to these keys represent a single <Key> entry.
#
# For example:
#
# # YAML                                        # XML
# MyNewContainer:                               # <Container name="MyNewContainer">
#   MyLocalizedString:                          #   <Key ID="STR_ESM_MyLocalizedString">

# Formatting:
#   - Discord markdown is supported
#   - Any new line characters will be replaced with an Arma 3 line break (<br/>) when compiled.
#     These will then be converted back to new lines by the bot. This is because XML does not
#     support new line characters and will be normalized to a space
