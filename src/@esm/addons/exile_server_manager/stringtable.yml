# This file is a YAML representation of Arma 3's stringtable.xml containers and keys
# This file is read in and transformed into the full stringtable.xml file that we know and love
#
# Note: The build process will transform this data into something XML can understand. All "id"
# values defined will automatically have `STR_ESM_` prepended to them
#
# Syntax:
#
# Each root key represents a <Container> entry in the resulting XML. The associated value
# to these keys represent a single <Key> entry.
#
# For example:
#
# # YAML                                      # XML
# MyNewContainer:                             # <Container name="MyNewContainer">
# - id: "MyLocalizedString"                   #   <Key ID="STR_ESM_MyLocalizedString">
#   arguments:                                #     <!-- %1 - Some argument | %2 - Another -->
#   - Some argument                           #
#   - Another                                 #

#                                             #   </Key>
